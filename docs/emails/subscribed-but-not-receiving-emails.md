Before checking the steps below, please check that you've confirmed your subscription. If you've entered your details on [our website](https://northoffalydojo.xyz/subscribe/), you'll need to check your emails for a confirmation email. **You won't be subscribed without this.**  

### Gmail

Sometimes our emails may end up in your promotions folder. If you have it enabled, check your promotions folder. If you find an email from us in either of those places, we recommend that you move it to your inbox. You'll tell Gmail that you want to get emails from us, and they'll start showing up in your inbox. 

### Outlook/Hotmail/Live

You may find our emails in the "Other" tab. If not, try your spam folder. 

### None of this worked

Submit a  [ticket with us](https://portal.northoffalydojo.xyz/support/#/tickets/new), and we'll help you figure out what the problem is.
