In-person sessions have been paused as a result of our move online due to Covid-19 restrictions. Now that restrictions are lifted, we are planning some form of in-person sessions to take place in the 2022-2023 term. A lot of our infrastructure is based around online sessions, and we're working hard on a in-person option that works for as many of our members as possible. 

In the meantime, you can register online [here](https://northoffalydojo.com/register).
