Following new advice from the CoderDojo Foundation, we changed the way parents book tickets for our online sessions. 

Any booking links will require that parents book a minimum of 2 tickets - one for yourself and one per child. This is to ensure parents are booking tickets.

The below GIF walks through the new process.
