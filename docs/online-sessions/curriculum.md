In our beginner group, we teach our young people how to code using Scratch (https://scratch.mit.edu) using fun projects where they build a different game, each week building in difficulty.

In our intermediate group, we place a strong focus on independent project development using skills developed in their time in the beginner group. In the group, we enter several exhibitions throughout the course of the year, including [Coolest Projects](https://coolestprojects.org) and [Astro Pi](https://astro-pi.org).
