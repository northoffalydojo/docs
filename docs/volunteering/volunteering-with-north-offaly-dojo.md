Absolutely! All CoderDojo's are 100% powered by volunteers, ours included. Please note you will need to be Garda Vetted which we will conduct. You will need it completed before you are allowed to participate, but we will help you along the process. 

To start the application process, go to https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/VolunteerApplication21.
