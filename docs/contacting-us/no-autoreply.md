If you sent your email to northoffaly.ie@coderdojo.com or team@northoffalydojo.xyz, you will receive an autoresponse.

### If you have a Gmail account:  

If you didn't receive one, please check your Promotions folder (if it's enabled) and your Spam folder. If you do not see an autoresponse in either of these folders, please send your email again. 

### Any other provider: 

Please check your spam folder. If you do not see an autoresponse in either your inbox or spam folder, please send your email again.
