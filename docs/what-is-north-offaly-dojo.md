North Offaly CoderDojo is part of the CoderDojo movement of free coding clubs. At our Dojo, Ninjas learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and explore technology in an informal and creative environment.

We run free online coding sessions for young people aged 7-15 to learn how to code using Scratch.
